ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Chaima Saad, a first-year master's student passionate about software engineering with a focus on web development.

ðŸ‘€ I'm currently delving into the MERN stack, exploring MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

ðŸŒ± Learning and growth are central to my journey in modern web development. I love tackling coding challenges and bringing ideas to life through web applications.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she

âš¡ Fun fact: Beyond coding, I find joy in playing basketball. I firmly believe that achieving a balance between work and play is crucial for a fulfilling life.
